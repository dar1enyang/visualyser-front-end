Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

### `npm start`

Builds the app in development mode and starts a web server. <br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. <br />
The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app in production mode and stores it in the `build/` directory. <br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. <br />
By default, it also includes a service worker so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
